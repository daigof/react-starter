# react-starter
This is a react starter-kit soultion.
It contains:
* webpack (check webpack.conf.js file and just run webpack)
* offline JSX transformation with babel
* support for es2015
* browser-sync
* eslint conf (I run this as ATOM plugin, not yet integrated to webpack, feel free to run manually)
* tern conf (ATOM plugin, otherwise ignore)
* editorconfig

##Setup
1. Just run: `npm install`
2. and then `webpack`
3. Then run browser-sync `browser-sync start --server dist`
